# cs224-final

## Goal
Applying skills and concepts from labs 1 - 7 into a MIPS program

## Milestones
* Week 4  70%  - read n,k from cmdline; convert to ints; swap if n < k.
* Week 5  75%  - set n=6,k=4 as default; exit if args are not numbers 
* Week 6  80%  - compute n! and k!
* Week 7  85%  - compute C(n,k) = n!/((n-k)!k!).
* Week 8  90%  - display row n of Pascal's triangle for k = 0 to n. 
* Week 9  95%  - display all rows i of Pascal's triangle, i = 0 to n.
* Week 10 100%  - write a recursive function to compute C(n,k)

### Other Requirements
* Source must be well-documented and clean

	addi  $t0, $t0, 1   # add 1 to $t0 - BAD COMMENT
	addi  $t0, $t0, 1   # increment loop counter - GOOD COMMENT 
* Must write your own code
* Functionality for all preceeding stages must still work as you complete subsequent phases
* All phases must be written as a function
* Must demonstrate in class
